Stars of all types from our Milky Way Galaxy are visible in the background.

To celebrate, consider this view of the rising Sun and a lovely set of ice halos recorded on a cold winter morning near Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA, planet Earth. Produced by sunlight shining through common atmospheric ice crystals with hexagonal cross-sections, such halos can actually be seen more often than rainbows. The remarkable sunrise picture captures a beautiful assortment of the types most frequently seen, including a sun pillar (center) just above the rising Sun surrounded by a 22 degree halo arc. Completing a triple sunrise illusion, sundogs appear at the far left and far right edges of the 22 degree arc. An upper tangent arc is also just visible at the very top of the view.","user":"NASAAPIs"},"https:\/\/apod.nasa.gov\/apod\/image\/1307\/earthmoon2_cassini_960.jpg":{"likes":"1","title":"Earth and Moon from Saturn","desc":"You are here.

Quickly released unprocessed images were released Saturday showing several streaks that are not stars but rather cosmic rays that struck the digital camera while it was taking the image.

Orientation and composition give a strong sense of depth to this colorful galaxy portrait that covers an area about the angular size of the full moon. This giant galaxy's yellowish core is dominated by the light from old, cool stars. Beyond the core, spiral arms filled with young blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions sweep past a smaller satellite galaxy at the lower left, reminiscent of the Milky Way's satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud.","user":"NASAAPIs"},"postsTyson1.jpg":{"likes":2,"title":"","desc":"","user":"Tyson"},"https:\/\/apod.nasa.gov\/apod\/image\/0004\/aurora_safar.jpg":{"likes":"1","title":"Aurora in Red and Yellow","desc":"The past week brought some spectacular aurora to northern skies.

When the shock wave reached the Earth on April 6, the resulting aurora could be seen in clear skies as far south as North Carolina.  As the aurorae occurred high in the Earth's atmosphere, they were accompanied by an unusual alignment of planets far in the background.

The atmospheric photo was taken on September 11 from the desert shore along the Skeleton Coast of Namibia. So close to moonset, the moonlight is reddened and dimmed by the low, long line-of-sight across the Atlantic. But near the center of the frame Venus still shines brightly, its light reflected in calm ocean waters. The celestial beacon above the brilliant evening star is bright planet Jupiter. Namibia's Skeleton Coast was so named for the many seal and whale bones that were once strewn along the shoreline.

This superbly detailed view reveals its bright nucleus, grand spiral arms and sweeping cosmic dust lanes with a scale comparable to the Milky Way. Hinting at a disorderly past, a remarkable dust lane runs straight through the disk, below and right of the galactic center, contrary to M81's other prominent spiral features. The errant dust lane may be the lingering result of a close encounter between M81 and its smaller companion galaxy, M82. Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 (aka NGC 3031) has yielded one of the best determined distances for an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years.","user":"NASAAPIs"},"https:\/\/apod.nasa.gov\/apod\/image\/0504\/amateur_wienerroither.jpg":{"likes":"1","title":"A Window to the Once Secret Sky","desc":"If there were a window nearby to the distant universe -- would you look through it?  Quite possibly, there is, in the form of a small telescope.  A local skykeeper could be a relative or a stranger and is frequently proud to show off the sky free of charge.  Through a window called an eyepiece, on a dark cloudless night, you can see clusters of stars, rings around Saturn, glowing nebulas of gas, craters on the Moon, and galaxies across the universe. The technology to create this window -- and the secret sky it reveals -- was unknown only 400 years ago.  Modern sky opportunities may occur this Saturday, Astronomy Day, at local amateur astronomy clubs, universities, science centers, or planetariums.  Pictured above is a small telescope being deployed at picturesque Hohe Wand, about 50 kilometers south of Vienna, Austria.  The spin of the Earth is visible in the above photo as the long star trails.","user":"NASAAPIs"},"postsNikhilAnand3.jpg":{"likes":1,"title":"Earth from moon","desc":"1968 when apollo 8 first orbited the moon","user":"NikhilAnand"},"https:\/\/apod.nasa.gov\/apod\/image\/0011\/bean_conrad.jpg":{"likes":"1","title":"Apollo 12: Self-Portrait","desc":"Is it art?

The image is dramatic and stark. Bean is faceless. The harsh environment of the Moon's Ocean of Storms is echoed in his helmet's perfectly composed reflection of Conrad and the lunar horizon. Works of photojournalists originally intent on recording the human condition on planet Earth, such as Lewis W. Hine's images from New York City in the early 20th century, or Margaret Bourke-White's magazine photography are widely regarded as art. Similarly many documentary astronomy and space images can be appreciated for their artistic and esthetic appeal.","user":"NASAAPIs"}}
